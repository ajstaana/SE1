                <h1>Japanese Occupation (1896 - 1898)</h1>
                <p>
                    The Philippines endured a brutal period of Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan swiftly invaded, overwhelming American and Filipino forces. By May 1942, Corregidor, a symbol of resistance, had surrendered. The Japanese rule was harsh, suppressing Filipino culture and language while subjecting Filipinos to forced labor. Brutal executions and atrocities against civilians became commonplace. Yet, the Filipino spirit remained unbroken. Widespread guerrilla movements, fueled by American support, rose throughout the islands, constantly disrupting Japanese control. The tide turned in 1944 with General MacArthur's return. Allied forces, alongside Filipino guerrillas, gradually liberated the Philippines. Though freedom was won in 1945 with Japan's surrender, the legacy of the occupation was devastating. The Philippines lost countless lives, suffered widespread destruction, and bore deep psychological scars. The nation spent years rebuilding after the war.
