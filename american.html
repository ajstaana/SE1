                <h1>Philippine-American War (1898 - 1902)</h1>
                <p>
                    In 1898, after centuries under Spain, the Philippines became a U.S. possession following the Spanish-American War. Filipinos, already declared independent under Aguinaldo, fought back in the Philippine-American War (1899-1902). Antonio Luna was a prominent Filipino general during the Philippine Revolution against Spain. Luna continued to fight for independence, leading the Philippine Army against the American forces in the Philippine-American War (1899-1902). The US focused on infrastructure, education with English as the medium, and public health. Their "Benevolent Assimilation" aimed to prepare Filipinos for self-rule, but control remained largely American. Filipinos desire for independence remained strong. Political parties advocating for self-governance emerged, and Filipinos increasingly participated in US-led structures. The economic system shifted towards cash crops like sugar and tobacco, benefiting some but widening social and economic gaps. English became widely spoken, and American influence impacted Philippine political and educational systems. Despite these changes, the fight for independence continued, culminating in Philippine independence in 1946. The American colonial period left a lasting mark, a complex legacy of progress and struggle.
