                <h1>Philippine Revolution (1896 - 1898)</h1>
                <p>
                    On February 17, 1872, Filipino priests Francisco Gomez, Jose Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora (GOMBURZA) were murdered with a garrote while blindfolded and sitting on a scaffold in Bagumbayan (now Luneta Park). They received the death sentence for their alleged involvement in the 1872 Cavite Mutiny. The killings of the three Filipino priests inspired Dr. Jose Rizal and others in his time to reform and struggle for independence from Spain. Rizal's ideas and deeds sparked a profound awakening among the Filipino people through his writings, such as Noli me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, which emphasized the abuses and injustices of the Spanish colonial period. Bonifacio was among the founding members of La Liga Filipina, founded by Rizal in 1892. Andres inspired the Katipunero to confront the Spanish on the battlefield, plotting the independence of the Philippines.
